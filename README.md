# PlantTracker ðŸŒ³

## Purpose

This is a simple plant tracker, helping you understand
the plants you take care of.

Personally, I had no idea what I was doing when I first got into gardening. I cut my lawn too low, added too much fertilizer and then used a ton of pesticides - essentially killing my garden and destroying my local ecosystem.

Since that time, I've learned a lot from reading various gardening books, trying out different techniques and now - my garden is back to where it was and has a thriving ecosystem.

There aren't any really good tools to help you understand your garden - so I decided to build a simple one.
